# Haskell Project 2: A Scripting Language

Deadline: Friday 23rd April, 9pm

34% of the overall module grade

## Overview

The objective of this project is to implement a small scripting language,
consisting of expressions, variables, basic input/output and loops.

## Preparation

Some code is given as a starting point. You can download the code from the
Practicals/Haskell/Project1/Code directory on Studres. There are four files:

* `Expr.hs`, containing the definition of a basic expression type, an
  incomplete parser and an in- complete evaluator for expressions
* `REPL.hs`, containing the main loop (a Read-Eval-Print Loop) of the
  language, and some incomplete helper functions
* `Main.hs`, which initialises the REPL
* `Parsing.hs`, which contains the parsing library discussed in lectures

You will only need to change `Expr.hs` and `REPL.hs`. You are free to edit the
other files (but please make sure you say which in your report if so.)
To run the calculator, you can either:

* Load `Main.hs` into `ghci` and run the function `main`. You can also use
  `ghci` to test individual functions (and indeed I strongly recommend you do
  so!); or
* Compile to an executable with: `ghc --make Main.hs -o calc` at the terminal
  prompt, followed by running `./calc`.

You will find that in its current form, most inputs do nothing.

The structure of the system is a Read-Eval-Print loop which accepts commands
and prints responses. Initially, this supports only variable assignment and
printing results. By extending the available commands, you will build a
complete, if small, scripting language.

## Basic Requirements

The minimum requirement of this project is to implement the parts which are
currently `undefined` or applications of `error`, to complete the definition of
`eval` so that arithmetic operations work, complete the definition of process,
and to extend the expression language to support variables.

Further basic requirements will lead to a small scripting language which
supports variable assignment and update, and clean error handling. In particular,
you should include:

* A `quit` command to exit the system
* Tracking the system `State`, which initially includes the values of the
  current variables
* An improved parser. It currently only supports single digit numbers, and
  does not support whitespace. Extend it so that it supports multi-digit
  numbers and whitespace around operators.
* Support for strings, including relevant operators, in particular:
    + Concatenating strings
    + Converting between strings and integers
* A command for reading user input as strings

You should also add a `cabal` file to help build your system, and include
an appropriate collection of test cases.

Within these requirements, you are free to make any design choices you like
(for example, choice of operators and names of commands) as long as you
document those choices in your report.

A short example run might be the following:

```
> x = 40
> print x
40
> y = input
54             -- this is user input
> print ("Result is " ++ toString(x + toInt(y)))
Result is 94
```

In the above `++` is an operator for concatenating strings, and
`toString` and `toInt` are operators for converting between string and int.

A hint: To support strings as well an integers, you will need to change the
type of `eval`, and the type of the variable store in `State` so that they use
something other than `Int` for values. One possibility:

```
data Value = IntVal Int | StrVal String

eval :: [(Name, Value)] -> Expr -> Maybe Value
```

## Additional Requirements

For a higher grade, you should implement some of the following requirements:
for a grade higher than 13 you should implement at least two of the **Easy**
requirements and one **Medium**; for a grade higher than 17, you should
implement at least all of the **Easy** and **Medium** requirements (but note
that this doesnâ€™t guarantee a higher grade! You still need to implement them
well, and describe them clearly in a report.)

* **Easy** Add some appropriate tests using Quickcheck.
* **Easy** Support additional functions, such as `abs`, `mod` or `power`
* **Easy** Extend the parser to support negative numbers
* **Easy** Support floating point numbers
* **Medium** Use a binary search tree for storing variables instead of lists
  of pairs
* **Medium** Add a command to read and process input files containing a list of
  commands, rather than reading commands from the console
* **Medium** Implement better treatment of errors: instead of using
  `Maybe` and `Nothing` to indicate errors, look at the `Either` type and
  consider how to use this to represent specific errors
* **Medium** Add a command for making choices (i.e. an `if`...`then`...`else`
  construct)
* **Hard** Use Haskeline to add command history and completion
  (including tab completion of variable names) to the REPL.
* **Hard** Add a command for simple repetition. This should allow looping over
  a *block* of commands separated by a semicolon.  e.g., you could support:
  `repeat 10 { x = x + 1; print x }`
* **Hard** Add more expressive looping commands, such as `for` or `while` loops
* **Very hard** Allow defining and calling functions

You need not be limited by these: feel free to add your own extensions, but
be sure to document them in your report. I also recommend discussing potential
extensions with your tutor.

## Deliverables

Hand in via MMS, by the deadline, a `.zip` or `.tar.gz` file
containing three top level subdirectories as follows:

- A `Code` directory, containing your group's code, and should be the same for
  everyone in the group. There may be further subdirectories if you wish,
  containing the source code in well-commented `.hs` files.
  Everything that is needed to run your application should be in that directory,
  part of the Haskell standard library, or available via `cabal install`.
  Your tutor should be able to run your program from the command line
  of a bash shell.

- A `.hg` or `.git` directory containing your source repository.

- A `Report` directory, containing a group report of around 1500
    words, and an individual report of around 100--500 words.
   
The *group* report should include:

- A summary of the functionality of your program indicating the level of
  completeness with respect to the Basic Requirements, and any Additional
  Requirements.
- A description of how you tested your code.
- Any known problems with your code, where you do not meet the Basic
  Requirements or any Additional Requirements you attempted.
- Any specific problems you encountered which you were able to solve, and how
  you solved them.
- An accurate summary of provenance, i.e. stating which files or code fragments
  were

    - written by you
    - modified by you from the source files provided for this assignment
    - sourced from elsewhere and who wrote them

The *individual* report should describe your own contribution to the
group work, and summarise how you worked together as a team.
Both reports must be submitted in **PDF** format.

## Marking Guidelines

This practical will be marked according to the guidelines
at 
<https://info.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/student-handbook/learning-teaching/feedback.html>

To give an idea of how the guidelines will be applied to this project:

- The *most simple solution* which completes the definitions marked as
  `undefined` and `error` and extends the evaluator to support all arithmetic
  operations and variables, should get you a grade 7.
- To achieve a grade of 13, you need to complete the *basic requirements* with
  a well-commented, documented, fully-working solution, accompanied by a clear
  and informative report.  The report should address all the Basic
  Requirements, and should make clear which of these you have completed.
- To achieve a grade of 17 or higher you will need to implement at least the
  **Easy** and **Medium** additional requirements, with well-commented and
  documented code, accompanied by a clear and informative report.

Note that these are minimum requirements - not a guarantee of a particular
grade!
